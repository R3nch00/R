Concluding our R Data Science project, we learnt how to develop our credit card fraud detection model using machine learning. We used a variety of ML algorithms to implement this model and also plotted the respective performance curves for the models. We learnt how data can be analyzed and visualized to discern fraudulent transactions from other types of data.
