 In this data science research, the consumer segmentation model was explored. We created this using unsupervised learning, a kind of machine learning. In particular, we applied the K-means clustering clustering technique. After performing an analysis and data visualization, we implemented our method. I hope you liked reading about this R-based machine learning project for consumer segmentation.
